## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Prefixes are in the form of a shortened word followed by a / such as `po/` for policy or`md/` for meeting date. 
* Prefixes require a space before being used, such as `n/NAME e/EMAIL` requiring a space between `NAME` and `e/`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Managing Meetings

#### Meeting Scheduling and Rescheduling

Meetings are automatically sorted by their scheduled dates and times. When multiple meetings are scheduled for a client, InsuraConnect will organize them in ascending order, showing the earliest upcoming meeting at the top. This feature allows insurance agents to quickly glance at their schedule and prioritize upcoming meetings.

#### Automatic Purging of Expired Meetings

To ensure the schedule remains current and manageable, InsuraConnect automatically purges past meetings. Once a meeting's end time has passed, it will be removed from the system during the next refresh cycle. This helps to maintain an up-to-date schedule for users, focusing only on relevant future engagements.

#### Sorting Clients/Partners by Earliest Meeting

Clients and partners are sorted in the user interface according to the time of their earliest scheduled meeting. This sorting mechanism places those individuals with the most imminent meetings at the top of the list, allowing for efficient time management and planning. Should there be no scheduled meetings for a client or partner, they will be positioned in the list based on the default sorting criteria.

### Undoing a command: `undo`

Undoes a previous command.

Format: `undo`

* Only undoes commands that made changes to the address book

### Redoing a command: `redo`

Redoes a previous undid command

Format: `redo`

* Requires a successful prior undo command to redo
  
Examples:

* `delete 1`
* `undo`
* `redo`

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
